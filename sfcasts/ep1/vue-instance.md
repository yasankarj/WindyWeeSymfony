# Vue Instance & Dynamic Data

We've just seen the most basic thing you can do with Vue. And if you think of Vue
as a templating engine like Twig, it makes a lot of sense: we instantiated a new
Vue instance, told it *where* on the page to render and passed it a template.
And that *totally* worked. Booya!

## The data Option

When you instantiate Vue, you control it by passing a number of different *options*...
and a lot of this tutorial will be about learning what options are possible.
One of the *most* important ones is `data`. Unlike `el` and `template`, `data`
is a *function*. It returns an array - or, really, this is an "object" in JavaScript -
of variables that you want to pass into the template.

Notice that ESLint is *angry* - it's because this line is empty. Sometimes you need
to ignore it until you finish: it's a bit overeager. Let's create one new "data" -
one new "variable" - to pass into the template: `firstName` set to `Ryan`. That's
me!

[[[ code('b3df2605bc') ]]]

And now that we're passing a `firstName` variable into the template, we can say
"Hello" and `{{ firstName }}`. Yes, by *complete* coincidence, Vue uses the same
syntax as Twig to render things.

Before we try this, ESLint is *still* mad at me. Sheesh! It says:

> Expected method shorthand

As I mentioned, some of the options you pass to Vue are set to values - like
`el` and `template`, while others are *functions*. When you have a method in an
object like this, you can use a shorthand: `data() {`... which is just a lot more
attractive.

Oh, and at the bottom, temporarily add `window.app = app`. That will set our Vue
`app` as a global variable, which will let us play with it in our console. Ready?

[[[ code('85efcf92bc') ]]]

Refresh! It rendered! But it gets better! In your browser's console, type
`app.firstName`. You can *already* see that this equals Ryan! Any `data` key
becomes accessible as a property on our instance. Set this to `Beckett` - my son's
name... who is hopefully napping right now. Boom! The template *immediately* updates
for the new data. And we can change this over and over again.

So Vue is a lot like Twig - it renders templates and can pass variables into the
templates - but with this crazy-cool extra power that when we *change* a piece of
data, it automatically re-renders... which, of course, is exactly what we want.

## How the Vue Instance Rendering Really Works

And... at a high level... that's Vue! Yes, we're going to talk about *so* much
more, but you already understand its *main* purpose. Remove the global variable
and the `app =` code - we don't need that. ESLint will temporarily get mad because
it thinks it's weird that we're instantiating an object and not setting to a
variable, but that's fine... and it'll go away in a little while.

[[[ code('c484b06625') ]]]

Behind the scenes, when Vue renders, it actually calls a `render()` method on
the object, which you don't normally need to worry or care about. But to help
this all make more sense, I want you to *see* what this method *looks* like one
time. Stick with me, we're going to do some temporary experimentation.

I'm going to add a new `render()` function. As soon as I add this, when Vue renders
it will call *our* function instead of rendering it internally for us. But inside,
I'm going to put the *exact* code that Vue normally runs:
`return Vue.compile(this.$options.template)` - that's a special way to reference
the `template` option here - `.render.call(this, h)`.

[[[ code('40f1bb6f07') ]]]

I know, that's *totally* crazy, and you will *never* need to type this in a real
project. What this shows us is that Vue has a `compile()` function where you can
"compile" a template string and then call `render()` on it. The `.render.call` thing
is a fancy way of *basically* calling `.render()` and passing it the `h` variable,
which is another object that's good at dealing with DOM elements... and that you
don't need to worry about.

If we refresh now, it works *exactly* like before because our `render()` method
does exactly what Vue normally does. If you look at this, you might start to wonder:
why do we need a `template` option at all? We're just *reading* it in `render()`...
so it could live anywhere. Let's try that! Remove the option, and, at the top,
add `const template = ` the template string. In render, reference that local variable.

[[[ code('df6ad1cf19') ]]]

That should work, right? Let's find out. It totally does!

Ok, so let me tell you the big important point I'm trying to make. Vue... is
simple: it's a system where you can take a template string, render it, and pass
this `data` into the template... just like Twig.

Of course, as we start adding more to our app, this `template` variable is going
to get *huge* and ugly. To help with that, Vue has a very special organizational
concept called single file components. Let's create one next.
